## Problems

* due to not using javascript, at the State Compontent (Dropdown List) I can't get what I want like the design prototype.
* many html and css syntax that shouldn't be necessary but I still use it. still looking and learning how to write HTML & CSS in the "Right Way"
* some people code like this and some people code like that. maybe "the Right Way" is depending on personal style code.
